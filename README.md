# Python for DevOps Intro

## Why Python for DevOps considering Shell Scripting?

The choice between using shell scripting and Python in DevOps depends on the specific task or problem you're trying to solve. Both have their strengths and are suitable for different scenarios.

**Use Shell Scripting When:**

1. **System Administration Tasks:** Shell scripting is excellent for automating routine system administration tasks like managing files, directories, and processes. You can use shell scripts for tasks like starting/stopping services, managing users, and basic file manipulation.

2. **Command Line Interactions:** If your task primarily involves running command line tools and utilities, shell scripting can be more efficient. It's easy to call and control these utilities from a shell script.

3. **Rapid Prototyping:** If you need to quickly prototype a solution or perform one-off tasks, shell scripting is usually faster to write and execute. It's great for ad-hoc tasks.
